                    <p>Suheil Purewal was born in Ohio and raised in Lenexa, KS. At the age of 22, Suheil moved to Arizona where he made his life-long dream of becoming a pilot come true. Within a year, he earned his credentials to become an instructor. He spent the next few years working random flight jobs, and training new students to achieve their flight dreams as well.</p> 
                    <p>Still an avid aviation enthusiast, Suheil decided to make the move back to Kansas in order to be closer to his family. He started working at T-Mobile, where he met his wife of 3 years. During his time at T-Mobile he moved up the ranks and landed a position as an Operations Analyst. This position helped him discover his passion for improving efficiency and identifying system issues before they arise. Suheil is now working towards gaining experience as full-stack developer. During his freetime, he enjoys movies, video games, playing guitar and hanging out with his dog and wife.</p>
